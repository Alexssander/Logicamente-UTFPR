Here is the place to put the two jars used:
java_cup.jar  
JFlex.jar 

The jars can be downloaded from:
http://github.com/adolfont/KEMS/raw/master/kems.ext.lib/ext/java_cup.jar
http://github.com/adolfont/KEMS/raw/master/kems.ext.lib/ext/JFlex.jar

You also need to configure the build path to add these two jars and also Junit 4 library.
